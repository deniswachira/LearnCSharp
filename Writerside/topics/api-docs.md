# Introduction to C# Fundamentals

Welcome to C# Fundamentals, your stepping-stone into the modern, powerful world of C# programming. Whether you're taking your first steps or refreshing your knowledge, this guide is designed to deliver clear and concise explanations of core concepts.

## Hello world
```C#
using System;
namespace TourOfCsharp;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // This line prints "Hello, World" 
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World");
    }
}
```
#### _Explanation_ 
The line starting with // is a single line comment. C# single line comments start with // and continue to 
the end of the current line. C# also supports multi-line comments. Multi-line comments start with /* and end with */. 
The WriteLine method of the Console class, which is in the System namespace, produces the output of the program.
